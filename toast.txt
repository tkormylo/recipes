Bread

2 Slices of Bread
1 Working Toaster

Place 1 slice of bread into each open slot of the toaster. If you have a 4 slot toaster, use only 2 of the 4 slots. Press down on the toaster activation lever and allow the bread to cook until the toaster ejects the bread... as toast.

Allow toast to cool for 30 seconds, then remove the toast for the toaster and enjoy!
